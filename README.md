<h1>SQL Project where rows are being converted to HEX Code</h1>

<p>This is an sql project made on jupyter notebook with the sqlite3, in this project we have made a data base on memory and in that we have created a table <b>"AGES"</b> with collumns - "name", "age".</p>

<p>Then we have passed the input into the AGES table to fillin the data in the form of rows, now we have converted the data in the rows to "HEX" code after that the 1st observation is being shown as the output.</p>
